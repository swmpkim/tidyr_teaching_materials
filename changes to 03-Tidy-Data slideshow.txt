Changes made to 03-Tidy-Data.pptx
Originally from https://github.com/rstudio-education/master-the-tidyverse-instructors/tree/master/powerpoints
Updated by Kim Cressman, 2019-10-17, to incorporate the pivot() functions
and saved as 03-Tidy-Data-updated-with-pivot-functions.pptx


"gather()" to "pivot_longer()":
slide 21
slide 38 - also had to reduce font size from 70 to 60
slide 42 - changed a lot of this around to represent pivot_longer. the curve of the upper right corner on the gray box for values_to isn't quite right.
slides 43 - 48 updated appropriately
slide 49 - "convert = TRUE" changed to "names_ptypes"


"spread()" to "pivot_wider()":
slide 50
slide 64 - also had to reduce font size from 70 to 63
slide 68
slide 69 - added names_from and values_from because leaving them out caused an error:
> pollution %>% pivot_wider(size, amount)
Error in `$<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, ".name", value = "_") : 
  replacement has 1 row, data has 0
slide 69 - also took out text boxes and copied the tables from a previous slide. made sure animation still worked the same.
slides 70 - 71 updated appropriately


key/value stuff:
slide 40 - changed "key (former column names)" to "names_to (former column names)"
slide 41 - removed "key"; changed "value" to "values_to"
slide 66 - "key" to "names_from"
slide 67 - removed "key"; changed "value" to "values_from"
